"""Namespace for constraints on paragraph depth discovery.

For the purposes of this module a "symmetry" refers to two perfectly valid
solutions to a problem whose differences are irrelevant. For example, if the
distinctions between
a           vs.     a
STARS                   STARS
may not matter if we're planning to ignore the final STARS anyway. To "break"
this symmetry, we explicitly reject one solution; this reduces the number of
permutations we care about dramatically.
